# Welcome to R-Ladies RTP!

## Materials

- All source code at ...

- Slides at ...

# Recording and reporting your analysis

## Options

- Writing code in the Console -- error prone (especially typo prone!) and hard to keep track of

- R Script + LaTeX/Word -- can be reproducible with careful organization but still error prone

- R Markdown -- code, output, prose all in one place and fully reproducible, can call R scripts as well

## R Markdown

- R Markdown is an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic 
documents, presentations, and reports from R

- R Markdown documents are fully **reproducible**, they can be 
automatically regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes

- Important features:
    - YAML on top
    - Code in chunks
    - R Markdown syntax
        - Human readable!
        - Limited, so not too time consuming to master
    - Self contained workspace

# R Markdown

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
library(rmarkdown)
```

# How it works

## Report

- File -> New File -> R Markdown...

- Three types of content:
    + An (optional) YAML header surrounded by ---s
    + R code chunks surrounded by ```s
    + text mixed with simple text formatting

## Demo

Make sure you have `ggplot2` and `dplyr` installed.

In the Console:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
```

## Notebook

- When you open an R Markdown file in the RStudio IDE, it becomes a notebook interface for R. 

- You can run each code chunk by clicking the green arrow icon. RStudio executes the code and display the results inline with your file.

[DEMO]

## How it works

(in case you're interested...)

![](img/RMarkdownFlow.png)

- When you knit, R Markdown feeds the .Rmd file to knitr, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and its output.

- The markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by pandoc which is responsible for creating the finished format.

# Code chunks

## Code chunks

- Inserting a new code chunk:
    + keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)
    + the Insert command in the editor toolbar (see other languages as well)
    + typing the chunk delimiters (three backticks and then `{r}` to start, three backticks to end)

- When file is rendered R Markdown will run each code chunk and embed the results beneath the code chunk in your final report

## Chunk options

Chunk output can be customized with knitr options, arguments set in the {} of a chunk header.

Examples:

- `include = FALSE`: code runs and results be used by other chunks, but doesn't appear in finished file
- `echo = FALSE`:  prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file (useful way to embed figures)
- `message = FALSE`: messages do not appear in the finished file
- `warning = FALSE`: warnings do not appear in the finished file
- `fig.cap = "..."` adds a caption to graphical results

See [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) for all options.

## Caching

`cache = TRUE`

Tricky, but can be useful!
